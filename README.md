# Guess-Dev
This project idea was born during a Dev-Meeting. It is a web interface with a websocket backend to simplify the estimation process.

## Why?
Because why not. I made it in the process of learning Go

## Can I use it?
Yes. But it's german only and the numbers we estimate are a bit different. Maybe I adjust that in the future *cough*
